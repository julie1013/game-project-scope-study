## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
   Done

-   The data structure you plan to use.
   Arrays for the board, loops for setting up the board. I know that we are
   encouraged to use OOP to make this game. As of now I am not sure how this
   would work, but I imagine as I get further along in writing the program the
   answer to that will present itself-- for now I'm working on getting the basic
   game logic down.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
    I will store elements in variables and use jQuery

-   How you plan to approach this project.
    I willbreak down each problem into smaller problems, making as many functions
    as needed to make the code more concise and readable, and refactor the hell
    out of it to keep it "DRY".

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
    1. As a user, I want it to be clear how I can create an account and login.
    2. As a user, I want it to be clear how I can change my password.
    3. As a user, I want gameplay to be straightforward (ie click a square to
      make token appear)
    4. As a user, I want to keep track of how many games I've won.
    5. As a user, I want to have a fun visual experience while playing the game.
    6. As a user, I want to to be notified in a clear and fun way that I've
     won the game, or that the game is a tie.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
    I will break it down into as many functions as possible to facilitate
    debugging  and to make it more readable.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
      I will likely use cartoon drawings of characters I've created as tokens in
      lieu of X and O. The board will look "cartoony" as well.

-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
    I will commit after every change and push it to GitHub.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.
    I will definitely do the scorecounter.
    I will definitely implement hover effects and the like.
    Whether or not I will try any of the others is still up in the air, but
    if possible I would like to try to implement a "matching" with remote users
    and a chatroom.
